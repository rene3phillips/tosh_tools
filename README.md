## Special Shoutout

A huge shoutout to my son for testing this project and inspiring me to make it. His love for command-line interfaces and coding continues to inspire me, and it was his passion for technology that helped shape this idea. At just 10 years old, he and I came up with the business idea **90sReplay** together, a project that celebrates all things 90s! He's already sharing his own creative work on GitHub under the **90sReplay** name. Be sure to check out his cool projects and ideas!
